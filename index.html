                    I want to inform users of this
                    Service that these third parties have access to your
                    Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks

                    not to disclose or use the information for any other

                    Note that these external sites are not operated by
                    me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to

                    identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                    I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                    me with personal information,
                    I immediately delete this from our servers. If you
